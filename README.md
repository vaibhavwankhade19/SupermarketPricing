# Supermarket Pricing

This project contains a simple C++ program that calculates the price of a product based on the product code's digits.

TCS Quetions - 1 :

A supermarket maintains a pricing format for all its products. A value N is printed on each product. When the scanner reads the value N on the Item, the product of all the digits in the value N is the price of the item. The task here is to design the software such that given the code of any item N the product (multiplication) of all the digits of value should be computed(price). 

### Example
Input: 5244  
Output: 160 (5*2*4*4)
